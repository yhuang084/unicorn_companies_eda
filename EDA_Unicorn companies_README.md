## Purpose
A unicorn comapny is a privately held startup company valued at over US$1 billion. Unicorns have been gaining a lot of (capital) attention. According to PwC (https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/about/new-ventures/unicorns-five-trends.html)  The growth in pre-IPO financing has led to an increase in IPO funding, and as a result, average unicorn IPO proceeds have nearly quadrupled since 2016, from $234 million to $1 billion. To study the big players will help future investors have a better understanding and make the next move wisely in the capital market.
This project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a dataset that contains information on global unicorn companies* from 2007 to September 2023. The data is extracted from CBsight (https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies).

## Goal
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is important because it helps an analyst to know the data, clean its missing data, fix its incorrect data and prepare it for future modeling. The project is to clean the dataset and answer questions using visualizations.

Investors appreciate the technology industry's lucrative opportunities for long-term growth and resiliency during economic downturns. Our data shows that the technology industry outperforms other service industries (financial services, healthcare and insurance). During and post-Pandemic era. 229, or 318% more tech companies have become unicorns since the Pandemic.

Across all industries, there has been an upsurge in newly unicorns since 2020. But those newcomers don't necessarily have a high average valuation. We do see some companies in some industries soar during the Pandemic and grow significantly enough to become a unicorn, but more established companies are more preferred by investors. Quality does matter more than quantity.

**3. Where are most of unicorn located? What are the top industries in the top countries?**
